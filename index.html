<h3> My Hobbies </h3>
<p><img src="images/cat.png" id="pic1"> I have many hobbies, <span class="underline"> varying from sports to arts </span>. My first hobby, which I became attached to, was drawing, simply because of the creative freedom it offered. Furthermore, I attended a couple of art classes, and my family encouraged me to keep that hobby. Another hobby from my childhood is video games. As I grew, my cousins and friends introduced me to a whole new world, which I would immerse myself in. Even to this day, I play video games to <a href= "https://www.psypost.org/video-games-calm-the-body-after-stress-even-when-players-feel-on-edge" target="_blank" >relax and ease my mind</a>. These activities are some of my favorites, which I do most often.</p>


<h3>Past Experiences</h3>
<p> <img src="images/bingo.png" id="pic2">Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve had many experiences that molded me into the person I am today. From joining a club to help underprivileged students, where I learned to be kind and compassionate. To later volunteer at an event to help local senior citizens serve food and host <span class="bold">bingo </span>. Another significant experience was winning an award from the <a href= "https://www.soinc.org" target="_blank" >Science Olympiad</a> in front of an audience, which made me feel accomplished. Overall, this experience and the actions I have taken so far have helped make me the person I am today.</p>


<h3>Future Goals</h3>
<p>  <img src="images/future.png" id="pic3"> Looking ahead, I want to continue upgrading my skills in both aspects, academically and personally. My main goal right now is to pursue a career in bio or computer science by enrolling in a really good college. To achieve this goal, <span class="highlight"> I plan on taking <a href= "https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses" target="_blank" >AP-level classes</a> to gain recognition and experience in the field of these colleges </span>. In addition, I hope to intern in companies surrounded by and built on pure bio or computer science to gain hands-on experience. Setting priorities and goals will help me each my intended career/goals.</p>
